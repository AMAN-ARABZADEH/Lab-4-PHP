# Lab-4-PHP Database and File handling in Object Oriented Programming PHP
#Guestbook Application

This is a simple guestbook application that allows users to leave messages that are displayed on a page for everyone to see. 
The application is split into two parts: one that uses file handling for reading and writing messages, 
and another that uses PDO to connect to a database for added security.

#Features

Users can leave messages that are displayed on a page.
Messages are stored in either a file or a database, depending on which version of the application is being used.
The file-based version of the application uses simple file handling however in OOP (Object oriented way)  way to read and write messages.
The database-based version of the application uses PDO to connect to a database and read/write messages in a secure way.
Both versions of the application are included in the same repository for easy comparison.
